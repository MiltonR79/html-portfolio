<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Milton Rodriguez. I was born and raised in El Salvador in a small village surrounded by forest, animals, and smells from rainfall, flowers, exotic plants, trees, and soil.
  As a kid, I ran free on corn, bean, and sugar cane fields and explored mountains and rivers as I took my horse for feed and water.
  Growing up, I enjoyed drawing, painting, and helping others with their school projects, and I was always curious about things in general.</p>

<p>All those events contributed to my interest in capturing images mentally until I could afford my first digital camera.
  At age 20, I started taking art classes in Houston Tx at Glassell School of Art. I studied drawing, perspective, oil painting, and photography.
  I have background in business management, marketing, accounting, market expansion, product development and I am currently pursuing a career change in graphic and web design at SNHU.
  So far, I have completed a few projects in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.</p>

<p>My work is around the belief that beauty exists all around us.</p>
